# Flappy Bird Project

Welcome to the Flappy Bird project! This simple yet addictive game is implemented using the Pygame library in Python. The project also incorporates SQLite3 to store and manage high scores. Have fun playing and see how high you can score!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arv1903/Flappy-Bird.git
```

### Running the Game

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

- Press the spacebar to make the bird flap and navigate through the pipes.
- Avoid hitting the pipes to stay alive.
- Your score will increase for the number of time the bird survives.

## High Scores

The game keeps track of the highest scores achieved by players. The scores are stored in an SQLite database (`highscore.db`).
